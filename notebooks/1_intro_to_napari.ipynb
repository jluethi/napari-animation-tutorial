    "# Introduction to napari\n",
    "`napari` is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It’s designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. It’s built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).\n",
    "\n",
    "`napari` includes critical viewer features out-of-the-box, such as support for large multi-dimensional data, layering, and annotation. By integrating closely with the scientific Python ecosystem, napari can be easily coupled to leading machine learning and image analysis tools (e.g. scikit-image, scikit-learn, PyTorch), enabling more user-friendly automated analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "`napari` also supports bidirectional communication between the viewer and the Python kernel, which is especially useful when launching from jupyter notebooks or when using our built-in console. Using the console allows you to interactively load and save data from the viewer and control all the features of the viewer programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part is all about getting to know the core functionality of napari. You can launch napari from the console by activating your python environment (e.g. `conda activate napari-tutorial`) and then launching napari, just type `napari`. Or you can launch napari from within a jupyter notebook (great if you want to interact with napari from python and follow along in the tutorial)."

The fourth option allows you complete control over loading and visualization and is most suited for when you have data already loaded into your notebook from other sources.\n",
